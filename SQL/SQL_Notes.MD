# Databases
- Purpose of Databases:
    - Store and manage user data.
    - Can be simple (like an Excel spreadsheet) or complex (like Facebook’s system).
- Databases:
    - Operate behind the scenes in web applications.
    - Don’t be intimidated—learning to interact with them is key.
- Basics of SQL (Structured Query Language)
    - Used to interact with databases.
    - Has a simple syntax with a few key verbs.

# Databases and SQL
-**Why Use SQL?**
    - SQL queries run directly in the database, making them faster than processing data in application code.
- Purpose:
    - Databases store and manage data for web applications.
    - SQL (Structured Query Language) helps you query and manipulate this data.
- SQL Basics
    - What is SQL?
        -  A language to interact with databases.
        - Allows you to ask questions, and add or change data.
    - Simple Examples:
        - Show users who signed up with a specific promotion code.
        - List comments by a user, sorted by topic and date.
        - Find orders shipped to states with over 1,000 users.
- Key Concepts:
    - **Primary Key**: Unique identifier for each record in a table (e.g., user ID).
    - **Foreign Key**: A column in one table that links to a primary key in another table (e.g., post author ID).
    - **Schema**: Structure of the database, including tables and their columns.

# SQL Commands
- Basics Commands:
    - `SELECT`: Retrieve data.
    - `INSERT INTO`: Add new data.
    - `UPDATE`: Modify existing data.
    - `DELETE FROM`: Remove data.
- Common Clauses:
    - `WHERE`: Filter records.
    - `LIKE`: Search for patterns.
    - `DISTINCT`: Get unique values.
- Aggregate Functions:
    - ` AVG()`, `COUNT()`, `SUM()`: Calculate values across rows.
- Indexes:
    -  Improve search speed for columns.

# Joining Tables
-Types of Joins:
    - `INNER JOIN`: Matches rows from both tables.
    - `LEFT OUTER JOIN`: All rows from the left table, with matched rows from the right table.
    - `RIGHT OUTER JOIN`: All rows from the right table, with matched rows from the left table.
    - `FULL OUTER JOIN`: All rows from both tables, with NULLs where there’s no match.

# Grouping and Filtering
- `GROUP BY`: Organize results into groups
- `HAVING`: Filter groups based on aggregate fuction
